# Day 2

Estimated time is 3 hours.

## Learning Objectives

- DOM manipulation.
- Object oriented programming.
- local and session storage.

# Projects
- `Store`

# Content

- Today you are going to build a project. You will use everything that you've learned so far, and the following:
  - [Local & Session storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv-9Yod83Q) in JavaScript.
  - Why Is [Array/Object Destructuring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIq3qLaHCIs) So Useful And How To Use It

# Project Instructions

- The website you'll build has a `Shop` & `Cart` page. `Shop` with all the products (You Decide) with a `add to cart` button.
  The `Cart` page lists all the products that has been added to the cart with a `Remove from cart` button that removes the product from the cart.
- If the product is added to the cart it should remain on the cart if the user refreshes the page and vise-versa. Hint* `localstorage`
- Use webpacks.
- The website will be a Single Page Application.
- Product's data should be stored inside of an array, inside objects.
  Example
  ```
  products = [
    {
      name: 'item1',
      etc...
    },
    {
      name: 'item2',
      etc...
    },
  ]
  ```


***Note Make sure you use `.gitignore` and do not commit `node_modules`**
